This is the chatbot of our University that will help us to get the information avilable on the official website. We can directly ask any question to our Chatbot and it is trained enough to response correctly.

Firstly install all the packages mentioned in "requirements.txt" file

We are using Langchain to complete the project. 

**In this project we are using :**

1) For data embedding - **"HuggingFaceEmbeddings"**
2) For Vector Database - **"FAISS"**
3) Model - **Ollama(model = "mistral")**
